### <a name="a"></a>Problem A
    1. Read the number N to encrypt : M = 265
    2. Interpret N as a decimal number : X1 = 265 (decimal)
    3. Convert the decimal interpretation of N to its binary representation : X1 = 100001001 (binary)
    4. Let b1 be equal to the number of 1’s in this binary representation : b1 = 3
    5. Interpret N as a Hexadecimal number : X2 = 265 (hexadecimal)
    6. Convert the hexadecimal interpretation of N to its binary representation : X2 = 1001100101
    7. Let b2 be equal to the number of 1’s in the last binary representation : b2 = 5
    8. The encryption is the result of M xor (b1 ∗ b2) : 265 xor (3*5) = 262


###### Input
    The first line will contain a number N which is the number of cases that you have to process. Each
    of the following N Lines (0 < N ≤ 1000) will contain the number M (0 < M ≤ 9999, in decimal
    representation) which is the number the student wants to encrypt.

###### Output
    You will have to output N lines, each containing the number b1 and b2 in that order, separated by one
     space corresponding to that lines number to crypt
